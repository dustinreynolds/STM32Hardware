# STM32Hardware
Repository for Kicad board development and support libraries

This repository was created on Windows using Kicad built from source using [kicad-winbuilder3.4](https://launchpad.net/kicad-winbuilder).

## Folder Hierarchy 
* Calculations - Brief calculations performed
* kicad_lib - Libraries created for new schematic or pcb objects
* Nucleo_L152RE - contains board designs that have been designed using Kicad build on 2015-03-26 from BZR commit 5542.

## Hardware Releases
So far none of the designs in this repository have been tested and verified to be working.  Footprints have been aligned with the actual components, but until the actual PCB's and the remaining components arrive, this repository should serve as a reference only.  This readme will be updated to reflect the latest testing status.
